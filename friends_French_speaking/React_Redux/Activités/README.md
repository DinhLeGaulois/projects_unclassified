# Planning Activities: React/Redux and SASS

---
# ATTENTION: NOT FINISHED YET!!!!
---

## Aim
> * The main goal of this project is to practice **React** with **Redux** and **SASS**. There will be no **database** or **backend**, just making request to **APIs**
> * There will be 2 main parts
>     - "Internal": activities from the application (measurement of **Body Mass Index**). 
>     - "External": requests to **APIs** (**GoogleMap**, **Library of Congress**).
> * These three parts are completely independent between them. We could create **button**, **link**, **tab**, etc. to select one of them very easily ...
> * Reusable **Modal**" which works all the time (not depending on "**z-index**"). This is not a "normal" **modal** (for example, when we click outside of the active area, NOTHING will happen because there is no code to execute such action to avoid too much code for so few convenient).
