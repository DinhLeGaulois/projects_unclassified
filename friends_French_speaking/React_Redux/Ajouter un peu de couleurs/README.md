# Colors with React/Redux Architecture


## AIM	
> * Trying to modify components *via* two external components: a button adds 1 to the counter of the specific components. The main purpose is to learn how the "**Store**", "**Containers**" and "**Components**" work together (with the help of "**Actions**") --> the basic **React/Redux** architecture
> * Not much interest, just check some features for the next projects ([here](https://github.com/DinhLeGaulois/activities_react_redux))
> * Have learned the IMMUTABILITY of the "**store**"

### This project respect totally the following architecture of React/Redux:

## Difficulties
> * "**Radio**" in group don't work well: events don't fire correctly when we click on one of them. Replace with "**Button**" which work perfectly.
> * Although the store is updated correctly when we select the active component, but the view is no up-to-dated accordingly. There is no problem of "dispatching", "reducing", etc. because we could see the store with new data as expected (*via* **DevTool**). Why? No idea ...
